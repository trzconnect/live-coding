Displaying Posts and Comments from JSON Placeholder

Write a TypeScript program that retrieves posts and their associated comments from the [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays them to the user.

The exercise consists of several steps:

- Retrieve the posts from the JSON Placeholder API's posts endpoint URL.
- Retrieve the comments from the JSON Placeholder API's comments endpoint URL.
- Display the posts with their titles and content.
- Associate each comment with its corresponding post by using the post's ID.
- Display the comments associated with each post.

This exercise will allow you to practice retrieving data from an API and displaying it to the user using TypeScript.
